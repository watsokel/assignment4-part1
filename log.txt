Task Log (CS290, PHP Assignment 4)

Start: Sun, 3 May 2015 22:00:00 -0700
End: Sun, 3 May 2015 22:22:46 -0700
Tasks: Corrected logic error. Originally used cast to check if input was valid (integer). However, this logic failed when zero was entered. Changed the program to use !is_numeric.

End: Sat, 2 May 2015 13:09:35 -0700
Tasks: turned error reporting back on as per professor's instructions on Piazza

End: Thu, 30 Apr 2015 17:15:32 -0700
Tasks: Corrected logic error in loopback.php (placed $_GET in both if construct instead of one $_GET and one $_POST). Fixed the problem with users maintaining the same page visit count in the login/content portion of the assignment.

Start: Thu, 30 Apr 2015 11:30:00 -0700
End: Thu, 30 Apr 2015 14:42:18 -0700
Tasks: Created content2.php, and corrected code for content1.php. Originally, I was checking for an active session, but that logic is incorrect. I should be checking for parameters inside the $_POST and $_SESSION arrays to assess the login status of the user.
